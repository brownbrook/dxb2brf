Quick tool to convert Duxbury DXB files to BRF

Usage: dxb2brf inputfile

This tool works with simple DXB files, it was built by reverse engineering the file format so there are likely a lot of things it still doesn't support. It works for the author though, and pull requests/bug reports are welcome if you run into something it doesn't support.

This tool is not endorsed by Duxbury in any way. I just needed to convert some files so I could read them and couldn't spend the money on software just to convert the file format.
